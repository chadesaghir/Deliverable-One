Hello my name is Chade Saghir and I'm excited to join the BootCamp. I hope we are going to learn a lot of fun things in this BootCamp. I'm excited to meet my classmates and instructors.
I'm very happy to see our city (Detroit) develop so nicely over the years. As an Urban Planner I'm watching a big city transform before of my eyes, and that is amazing. I have been in the 
downtown Detroit environment for almost 30 years as a student, resident, employee, and tourist. I'm just amazed at how much is going on. One of my favorite thing to do is to come downtown 
with my family wife and two kids and just walk around and visit the different urban parks and establishment.
